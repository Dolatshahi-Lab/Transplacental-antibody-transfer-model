% This function is a Matlab implementation of Rob Hyndman's Highest Density
% Region (HDR) R package titled "hdrcde".  It does not include the full
% functionality of that package.  Namely, it does not allow for multiple
% probabilities entered as an input (you can only provide one probability)
% and it does not output the distribution's mode, density plot, or boxplot.
% 
% The algorithm is outlined in Hyndman's 1996 article in The American
% Statistician called "Computing and Graphing Highest Density Regions". In
% it, he argues that HDR's are the most appropriate method for summarizing
% a probability distribution. The HDR can find the smallest interval of x
% in which the probability distribution, f(x), is densest, including the
% possibility of a disjoint interval, should the distribution be
% multimodal. 
%
% The user can read the paper for more information, but briefly, HDR works
% in the following manner. Let f(x) be the density function of a random
% variable X. Then the 100(1 - a)% HDR is the subset R(falpha) of the
% sample space of X such that R(falpha) = {x: f(x) >= falpha} where falpha
% is the largest constant such that Pr(X is an element of 
% R(falpha)) >= 1 - alpha. To be clear, this approach avoids explicit
% integration under f(x) by providing a density quantile approach.
