# Transplacental-antibody-transfer-model
Here we present the first kinetic dynamic model of antibody transfer through the placenta. The components of the model and the results figures are organized as follows:

01-Dynamic model
This folder includes two MATAB m files; (1) diggdt.m includes the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and (2) diggdt_driver.m calls and numerically solves the ODEs and plots the output. 

02-Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis
This folder includes MATLAB m files for (1) modified CaliPro...
Additionally data from Malek et al [ref] is included as CSV files.


03-Transwell Assay Simulation


04- Vaccine Module


Parameters_Erdogan.m includes the estimated parameter set using CaliPro that was used as the baseline model in the manuscript.
